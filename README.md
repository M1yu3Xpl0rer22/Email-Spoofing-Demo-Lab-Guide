## What Is Email Spoofing?

Email spoofing is when an attacker forges the "From" address of an email to make it look like it‚Äôs coming from a trusted source, such as a boss, company, or known contact, even though it isn‚Äôt. The attacker does not need access to the real email account ‚Äî they just fake the sender information in the email headers.

---

How Attackers Spoof Email (Methods)

One common method is using SMTP servers (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). SMTP often does not verify the sender‚Äôs identity by default, which lets attackers send emails from command-line tools or custom scripts with fake "From" addresses.

Tools attackers commonly use include:

* Telnet or Netcat for manual sending
* Sendmail
* SMTP libraries in Python (like smtplib)
* Spoofing tools such as Social Engineering Toolkit (SET), Metasploit, or SendEmail (Linux tool)

Python Spoofing Demo Code (Educational Use Only)

Below is a simple Python script that demonstrates how an email spoof can be sent using smtplib:

```python
import smtplib
from email.message import EmailMessage

msg = EmailMessage()
msg.set_content("This is a spoofed email for demonstration.")
msg['Subject'] = 'Urgent: Action Required'
msg['From'] = 'ceo@company.com'       # forged sender address
msg['To'] = 'victim@example.com'

with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com', 25) as server:
    server.send_message(msg)
```

Note: Replace 'smtp.example.com' with the address of your SMTP server. Keep in mind most real SMTP servers will block spoofed emails or require authentication and verification methods like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.

## üß∞ Techniques to Detect or Prevent Email Spoofing

| Technique                 | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SPF**                   | Checks if sending server is authorized for that domain            |
| **DKIM**                  | Cryptographic signatures verify integrity and sender of email     |
| **DMARC**                 | Builds on SPF/DKIM; defines policy for handling failed checks     |
| **Email Header Analysis** | Reviewing headers for discrepancies (Return-Path, Received lines) |

## üë®‚Äçüíª Real Spoofing Scenario (SOC View)

An attacker spoofs the CEO‚Äôs email and sends a message to HR requesting sensitive documents. The email passes basic SMTP delivery but **fails SPF/DKIM checks**.
Your SOC platform (e.g., Splunk, Sentinel) detects this due to DMARC failure and flags it suspicious.

| Topic         | Description                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spoofing Goal | Trick receiver into trusting the email sender               |
| Attack Tools  | Telnet, Python smtplib, SET, Metasploit                     |
| Detection     | SPF, DKIM, DMARC, header analysis                           |
| SOC Role      | Detect, alert, block spoofed emails before user interaction |

## üß™ Setting Up a Safe Lab Environment

### Recommended Local SMTP Servers for Testing Spoofing

| Tool        | Type               | Description                                 | OS                    |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| MailHog     | Fake SMTP + Web UI | Captures emails, no real delivery           | Linux, macOS, Windows |
| smtp4dev    | Fake SMTP + GUI    | Windows-friendly GUI inbox                  | Windows (also Docker) |
| Postfix     | Real SMTP server   | Configurable local SMTP server              | Linux                 |
| MailCatcher | Fake SMTP + Web UI | Lightweight Ruby tool to catch emails       | Linux, macOS          |
| smtp-sink   | SMTP sink          | Accepts & discards emails (terminal output) | Linux                 |

## What is MailCatcher?
MailCatcher is a simple tool designed to help developers test and debug email sending in their applications without actually sending real emails over the internet.

It acts as a fake SMTP server that captures all emails sent to it and provides a web interface where you can view those emails in your browser.

Key Features of MailCatcher:
Captures Emails Locally: Instead of sending emails to real recipients, MailCatcher catches them so you can safely inspect the content.

Web Interface: You can open a local web page (usually at http://localhost:1080) to see the emails, read their content, headers, and attachments.

Easy Setup: Runs as a standalone Ruby gem; simple to install and use on Linux, macOS, or Windows (with Ruby installed).

Great for Development: Perfect for developers who want to test email functionality in their code without spamming real inboxes or worrying about email delivery failures.

No Actual Email Delivery: Emails captured by MailCatcher don‚Äôt leave your machine or get sent to real email addresses.

How MailCatcher Works:
You configure your app or script to send emails through MailCatcher‚Äôs SMTP server (usually localhost on port 1025).

MailCatcher receives these emails and stores them.

You open the MailCatcher web UI at http://localhost:1080 to browse and read the captured emails.

Use Case Example
Say you‚Äôre developing a web app that sends confirmation emails when users sign up. Instead of sending real emails every time during development, you point your app‚Äôs SMTP settings to MailCatcher. This way, you can verify the email content, subject, and headers safely on your local machine.


### How to install **MailCatcher** on Linux (Debian/Kali)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev build-essential libsqlite3-dev -y
sudo gem install mailcatcher
mailcatcher
```

* SMTP server: `localhost:1025`
* Web UI: [http://localhost:1080](http://localhost:1080)

### Python test script for MailCatcher

```python
import smtplib
from email.message import EmailMessage

msg = EmailMessage()
msg.set_content("This is a spoofed email test.")
msg['Subject'] = 'Test Alert'
msg['From'] = 'ceo@fakecorp.com'
msg['To'] = 'victim@example.com'

with smtplib.SMTP('localhost', 1025) as server:
    server.send_message(msg)
```

Open [http://localhost:1080](http://localhost:1080) in your browser to see the intercepted email.

### Troubleshooting Kali Linux package issues

If you get errors like `404 Not Found` or "Unable to locate package":

1. Fix your Kali sources list:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Replace contents with:

```
deb https://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
```

2. Add Kali signing key:

```bash
sudo apt install -y gnupg curl
curl -fsSL https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/kali.gpg
```

3. Clean and update:

```bash
sudo apt clean
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

4. Install needed packages:

```bash
sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev build-essential libsqlite3-dev
```

---

### Alternative: Use Docker to run MailCatcher (no package dependencies)

```bash
docker run -d -p 1025:1025 -p 1080:1080 schickling/mailcatcher
```

Access Web UI: [http://localhost:1080](http://localhost:1080)
